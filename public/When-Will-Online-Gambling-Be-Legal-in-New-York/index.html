            <h1 id="When-Will-Online-Gambling-Be-Legal-in-New-York"><a href="#When-Will-Online-Gambling-Be-Legal-in-New-York" class="headerlink" title="When Will Online Gambling Be Legal in New York?"></a>When Will Online Gambling Be Legal in New York?</h1><p>A recent report issued by the New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) has given some clarity to the situation around online gambling in New York. The commission has stated that it intends to allow casino-style gambling to be conducted over the internet, but only if it can be assured that the games are fair and secure.</p>
<p>The announcement is good news for online gambling fans in New York, as it removes some of the remaining uncertainty about the legal status of the activity. Nevertheless, there is still some way to go before online gambling is made fully legal in the state.</p>
<p>It is thought that the NYSGC will need to further clarify its position on online gambling before any final decisions are made about implementation. In particular, lawmakers will need to agree on a regulatory framework governing internet-based gaming operations.</p>
<p>This process is likely to take some time, so it may be a while yet before online gambling becomes a reality in New York. In the meantime, players can continue to enjoy real money slots and other casino games at offshore sites that are licensed and regulated in jurisdictions outside of the United States.</p>
<h1 id="When-Will-NY-Settles-its-Online-Gambling-Dispute"><a href="#When-Will-NY-Settles-its-Online-Gambling-Dispute" class="headerlink" title="When Will NY Settles its Online Gambling Dispute?"></a>When Will NY Settles its Online Gambling Dispute?</h1><p>The future of online gambling in New York is still murky, as the state continues to dispute its right to offer such games. Legislators first introduced a bill to legalize and regulate online poker and other casino games in 2012, but it never made it out of committee. In December 2013, the Division of Gaming Enforcement released a report concluding that New York had the legal authority to offer online gambling.</p>
<p>Despite this finding, Governor Andrew Cuomo continues to express reservations about legalizing and regulating online gambling. In January 2014, he commissioned a study on the potential social and economic effects of online gambling. The study is scheduled to be released in early 2015.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the race is on in other states to take advantage of the estimated $7 billion that will be gambled online in the United States this year. Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey have all legalized some form of online gambling, while several other states are considering legislation.</p>
<p>It’s not clear why Cuomo is dragging his feet on legalizing online gambling. There doesn’t seem to be any opposition from legislators or the general public. It could be that Cuomo is worried about the potential negative consequences of legalization, such as addiction and money laundering. But it’s also possible that Cuomo is getting pressure from casinos and racetracks, which would lose business if people could gamble online instead.</p>
<p>No one knows for sure when New York will legalize online gambling, but it’s likely that it will happen eventually. In the meantime, gamblers can cross the border into other states or place bets with offshore operators.</p>
<h1 id="NY-Players-Waiting-for-Online-Casino-Legalization"><a href="#NY-Players-Waiting-for-Online-Casino-Legalization" class="headerlink" title="NY Players Waiting for Online Casino Legalization"></a>NY Players Waiting for Online Casino Legalization</h1><p>Since New York state legislators legalized commercial casino gambling in 2013, there’s been talk about permitting online versions of those casinos, too. But the wheels of government turn slowly and there’s still no indication when or even if internet-based gambling will be allowed in the Empire State.</p>
<p>In the meantime, players are waiting. And they’re not just from New York; people in neighboring states are watching closely as well, because they could easily cross the border to place bets if online casinos are made available.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of money at stake. The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that around $4.5 billion was wagered on illegal sports betting in 2016, and that 78 percent of that total was bet online. If online casinos were to be legalized and regulated in New York, it would presumably cut into that market share.</p>
<p>That said, there are plenty of skeptics who don’t think legalizing online casinos is a good idea, for a variety of reasons:</p>
<p>– Opponents argue that it will be difficult to track how much money is being wagered and lost, making it difficult to enforce responsible gambling rules.</p>
<p>– There’s also a concern that online casinos will be more addictive and dangerous than their land-based counterparts. Players might not be able to control their spending as easily if they’re gambling from home.</p>
<p>– Some opponents maintain that legalizing online casinos will cannibalize revenue from the state’s brick-and-mortar casinos, which have already paid licensing fees and taxes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are supporters who believe that regulating and taxing online casinos will bring in new tax revenue for the state government – an estimated $300 million annually, according to one report. And proponents argue that it would be easier to enforce responsible gambling rules with online casinos than with illegal bookmakers and offshore gaming websites.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Slots-of-Riches-Await-with-Legalization-of-Online-Gambling"><a href="#New-York-Slots-of-Riches-Await-with-Legalization-of-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New York Slots of Riches Await with Legalization of Online Gambling"></a>New York Slots of Riches Await with Legalization of Online Gambling</h1><p>In the state of New York, there are a number of casinos that offer gamblers hours of fun and excitement. However, with the recent legalization of online gambling in the state, New Yorkers now have even more options for enjoying casino games. There are a number of reputable online casinos that welcome players from New York, and these casinos offer a wide variety of games, bonuses, and promotions.</p>
<p>There is something for everyone when it comes to online gambling in New York. Whether you are into slots, blackjack, poker, or any other game, you can find an online casino that caters to your interests. And because online casinos are available around the clock, you can enjoy your favorite games any time you want.</p>
<p>Another great thing about playing at online casinos is the bonuses and promotions that are typically offered. Some casinos will give new players a bonus just for signing up, while others offer rewards for playing specific games or making deposits. There are also loyalty programs available at many online casinos that give players rewards for their loyalty. These rewards can range from cash back on bets to complimentary hotel stays and air travel.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a great way to enjoy some casino action, be sure to check out the online casinos available in New York. With so many great options to choose from, you are sure to find the perfect casino for your needs. So get ready to experience all the excitement and riches that come with legalized online gambling in New York!</p>
<h1 id="Legalized-Online-Gambling-in-New-York-a-Matter-of-When-Not-If"><a href="#Legalized-Online-Gambling-in-New-York-a-Matter-of-When-Not-If" class="headerlink" title="Legalized Online Gambling in New York a Matter of When, Not If"></a>Legalized Online Gambling in New York a Matter of When, Not If</h1><p>The legalization of online gambling in New York is inevitable. That’s the consensus of many industry experts, as well as New York state officials.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this. First, there is the rapidly growing popularity of online gambling worldwide. In 2015, global online gambling revenues reached $41.5 billion, according to research firm H2 Gambling Capital. This figure is expected to reach $60 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>Second, there is the increasing pressure on states to legalize and regulate online gambling. This pressure has come from two sources: casino operators and consumer advocates. Casino operators want to legalize online gambling in order to capture a piece of the global market. Consumer advocates want to legalize online gambling in order to protect consumers from unscrupulous operators and to ensure that the revenues are used for public purposes, such as education and infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p>Third, there is the growing acceptance of online gambling by state governments. In recent years, several states have legalized some form of online gambling (e.g., poker, casino games). These states include New Jersey, Delaware, Nevada, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Fourth, there is the experience of other countries with legalized online gambling. These countries include the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. Each of these countries has seen a growth in tourism and jobs related to online gambling, as well as a increase in tax revenue from online gambling operations.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the experience of New York with Native American-run casinos. Since 2013, New York has authorized seven Indian casinos operated by four tribes (Oneida Nation of New York; Seneca Nation of New York; St Regis Mohawk Tribe; Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans). These casinos have been a major success, generating millions of dollars in revenue for the tribes and creating thousands of jobs. The same model could be used for licensed and regulated online casinos in New York.</p>
<p>Given all these factors, it’s clear that legalized online gambling in New York is only a matter of time.</p>
