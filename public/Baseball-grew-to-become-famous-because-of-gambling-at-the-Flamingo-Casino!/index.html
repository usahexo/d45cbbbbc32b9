It was here where the first professional game was ever played outside of North America, on November 2, 1878. This momentous event helped to further popularize baseball around the world and contributed to its eventual transformation into a global phenomenon.</p>
<p>In those days, there were few professional sports teams outside of North America. The vast majority of the world’s population lived in Europe, Asia, or other parts of the world that were far away from America. Baseball was still a relatively new sport at this time and had not yet gained broad international appeal.</p>
<p>The Flamingo Casino represented an opportunity for baseball to spread its wings and reach new audiences. European and Asian fans had never seen a live game of baseball before, and the novelty of the sport quickly captured their imaginations. Baseball soon became one of the most popular sports in the world, and its popularity continues to grow today.</p>
<p>The Flamingo Casino helped to make baseball a truly global phenomenon, and we are grateful for its contributions to our sport. Thanks, Flamingo!</p>
