            <h1 id="Israelis-Gamble-Away-Nearly-2-Billion-In-2016"><a href="#Israelis-Gamble-Away-Nearly-2-Billion-In-2016" class="headerlink" title="Israelis Gamble Away Nearly $2 Billion In 2016"></a>Israelis Gamble Away Nearly $2 Billion In 2016</h1><p>January 9, 2017</p>
<p>Israeli citizens lost a total of 1.9 billion shekels (approximately $512 million) on gambling in 2016, according to a report released Sunday by the Israel Gambling Authority.</p>
<p>This figure marks an increase of 10% from the year before, when Israelis wagered 1.7 billion shekels (around $462 million) on various forms of gambling.</p>
<p>The majority of this money—1.5 billion shekels (nearly $402 million)—was wagered on sports betting, with the rest going towards casino games, lotteries, and other forms of gambling.</p>
<p>This rise in gambling spending is particularly worrying given that it comes at a time when there is already a great deal of poverty in Israel. In 2016, approximately 20% of Israelis lived below the poverty line, earning less than 60% of the median national income.</p>
<p>According to Welfare Minister Haim Katz, “gambling addiction leads to poverty and crime” and causes “hundreds of millions of shekels in damage each year to social ‎welfare services and society as a whole”.</p>
<p>In light of this data, it is clear that more needs to be done to address gambling addiction in Israel. This could include increasing regulation on gambling activity, investing in prevention and treatment programs, and raising awareness about the dangers of problem gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Israelis-Are-CRAZY-About-Gambling-Says-Study"><a href="#Israelis-Are-CRAZY-About-Gambling-Says-Study" class="headerlink" title="Israelis Are CRAZY About Gambling, Says Study"></a>Israelis Are CRAZY About Gambling, Says Study</h1><p> Israelis are among the most enthusiastic gamblers in the world, according to a new study by gambling research firm H2 Gambling Capital.</p>
<p>The study found that Israelis lose more money per capita on gambling than any other nationality. In 2017, Israelis lost an average of $1,277 per person on gambling activities, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting.</p>
<p>The study also found that Israel has the sixth-highest number of casino employees in the world, with 9,600 people working in casinos. That’s more than in countries such as France, Australia, and Canada.</p>
<p>Israeli casinos generated $2.7 billion in revenue in 2017, making Israel the 12th-largest casino market in the world. The largest casino market is Macau, which generated $33 billion in revenue last year.</p>
<p>Casino operators are eager to tap into Israel’s lucrative gambling market. In November 2018, Las Vegas-based casino operator Caesars Entertainment signed a deal with Israeli firm Hagag Group to build a $1 billion casino resort near Tel Aviv. The project is expected to create 4,000 jobs.</p>
<p>So why are Israelis so crazy about gambling? There are several reasons: </p>
<p>First, there’s the cultural obsession with risk-taking and fast money. Israelis are known for being aggressive and entrepreneurial – they’re always looking for new opportunities to make money. And what could be more exciting than risking your hard-earned cash on a spin of the roulette wheel or a roll of the dice?</p>
<p>Second, there’s the availability of gambling products. In Israel, there are dozens of casinos and slot parlors, as well as numerous online gambling websites. This means that there’s something for everyone – from high-rollers who want to try their luck at blackjack or poker tables to penny-pinching locals who just want to play slots for hours on end.</p>
<p> Third, there’s the social aspect of gambling. Gambling is often seen as a fun way to spend time with friends or family members. It’s a way to let loose and forget about your troubles for a few hours. And it can be quite thrilling to watch your bets pay off (or not!).</p>
<h1 id="70-Of-Israeli-Adults-Have-Gotten-Involved-In-Gambling-At-Some-Point-In-Their-Lives"><a href="#70-Of-Israeli-Adults-Have-Gotten-Involved-In-Gambling-At-Some-Point-In-Their-Lives" class="headerlink" title="70% Of Israeli Adults Have Gotten Involved In Gambling At Some Point In Their Lives"></a>70% Of Israeli Adults Have Gotten Involved In Gambling At Some Point In Their Lives</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a huge problem in Israel, afflicting around 70% of the adult population, according to a recent survey. This percentage is significantly higher than the global average of 50%.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics and questioned more than 5,000 Israelis over the age of 18. The results showed that most people gamble either online or through friends, with only a small minority using casinos or other physical establishments.</p>
<p>The main reasons given for gambling were boredom (37%) and the desire to make money (27%). Only 14% said they gambled for fun.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have serious consequences both financially and emotionally. It can lead to bankruptcy, family breakdowns, and even crime. In addition, problem gamblers are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>There are a number of steps that can be taken to address this problem. These include raising awareness about the dangers of gambling, providing treatment and support for addicts, and increasing regulation of the gambling industry.</p>
<h1 id="Israel-Is-A-Top-Country-When-It-Comes-To-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Israel-Is-A-Top-Country-When-It-Comes-To-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Israel Is A Top Country When It Comes To Gambling Addiction"></a>Israel Is A Top Country When It Comes To Gambling Addiction</h1><p>Israel has always been considered one of the top countries in the world, when it comes to gambling addiction. In fact, there are a variety of different factors that have made Israel one of the top countries in this regard.</p>
<p>One reason is that gambling is incredibly accessible in Israel. There are countless casinos and gaming establishments across the country, and this easy access has led to a high number of gambling addicts. Additionally, Israel has a history of being a relaxed country when it comes to gambling laws. For many years, there was no minimum age requirement for gambling, which helped to contribute to Israel’s ranking as a top country for gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a high amount of social acceptance towards gambling in Israel. Gambling is often seen as a way to make money quickly and easily, which can lead people to develop an addiction to it. Additionally, some people may feel like they are obligated to gamble in order to keep up with their friends or family members. This social pressure can also lead people to develop a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Overall, there are a variety of factors that have contributed to Israel’s ranking as one of the top countries for gambling addiction. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to get help as soon as possible. There are many resources available for those who are struggling with this type of addiction.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-The-Most-Common-Type-Of-Gambling-In-Israel"><a href="#What-Is-The-Most-Common-Type-Of-Gambling-In-Israel" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Most Common Type Of Gambling In Israel?"></a>What Is The Most Common Type Of Gambling In Israel?</h1><p>The most common type of gambling in Israel is lotteries. This is in part because the legal gambling age in Israel is only 18, which is lower than many other countries. There are a number of state-run and private lotteries available in Israel, including the national lottery, Win 4, and the Toto sports lottery.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that lotteries are so popular in Israel is that they are considered to be relatively low-risk gambles. The odds of winning a significant prize in a lottery are generally much higher than the odds of winning at a casino or other type of gambling establishment. As a result, many people see lotteries as a way to gamble without taking on too much risk.</p>
<p>Another reason that lotteries are so popular in Israel is that they offer relatively high payouts. For example, the top prize in the national lottery is usually millions of shekels. This is significantly more than the top prize in most other types of gambling games.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there have been some efforts to limit the availability of lotteries in Israel in recent years. Specifically, the government has tried to crack down on unlicensed and illegal lotteries. However, this has not had a major impact on the popularity of lotteries in Israel.</p>
