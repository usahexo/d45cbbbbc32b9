Check-In Time at Odawa Casino is 8am"></a>Haiti Welcomes You! Check-In Time at Odawa Casino is 8am</h1><p>The trip from the airport to the casino is about a half hour, and there’s plenty to see along the way. The narrow streets are flanked by brightly painted concrete buildings, many of which display arrays of laundry hung out to dry. Vendors hawk their wares from street stalls, and every few minutes a horse-drawn cart clatters past.</p>
<p>The casino is a large complex with several restaurants, a theater, and a spa. Our room is on the top floor with an excellent view of the bay. After freshening up we head down to the casino floor.</p>
<p>There’s a festive atmosphere in the air, and everyone seems to be having a good time. We try our luck at some of the slot machines and table games, and after awhile we retire to our room for a restful night’s sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning we wake up early and have breakfast in one of the casino restaurants. Then it’s off to the pool for some sun and relaxation. Later in the day we play more slots and table games, and before we know it, it’s time to head back to the airport for our flight home. Haiti has been very welcoming, and we can’t wait to come back!</p>

<p>The Odawa Casino Resort is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This promotion is good through the end of August.</p>
