#  Fastener secures Premier League title for Manchester City

Manchester City clinched the Premier League title on Sunday with a 1-0 win at home to West Ham United, thanks to a victor from substitute Raheem Sterling in the 85th minute.

It was an emotional end to the season for City captain Vincent Kompany, who played his last game for the club and was given an emotional send-off by the home fans.

City’s fifth league championship and first under manager Pep Guardiola means they become the first side in a decade to retain the title, after Manchester United won three in a row between 2007 and 2009.

“We were consistent all season. We were not perfect but we were so good so often that it didn’t matter,” Guardiola said in his post-match press conference. “The players deserve all my respect because they have been phenomenal from day one until the last day. We are happy, but there is still so much to do.”

Guardiola paid tribute to departing veteran Kompany, saying: “It was an incredible speech from Vincent Kompany and I will never forget what he said in his farewell speech. It meant so much to me and the players. I am really glad he could finish his career at this club in this way.”

Kompany himself tweeted: “Champions! What a team! What a journey! Thank you for accepting me as one of your own.”

Bundesliga Champions Bayern Munich have announced a new partnership with fastener manufacturer Fischer. The deal is for three years, and will see the company become the Official Fastener Supplier to the club.

As part of the agreement, Fischer will supply all of Bayern’s training facilities with fasteners, as well as providing product for use in matchday operations and on club merchandise.

Commenting on the deal, Bayern’s Commercial Director Joerg Wacker said: “This is an important step for our club in terms of securing our long-term future. We are delighted to have entered into this partnership with Fischer and we look forward to working together closely in the coming years.”

For Fischer, meanwhile, the partnership represents a significant opportunity to promote its products and services to one of Europe’s biggest clubs.

#  Fastener gives Juventus edge in Champions League semi-final

A powerful header from Giorgio Chiellini gave Juventus a crucial away goal as they defeated Barcelona 1-0 in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.

The Italian side, who have been inconsistent in Serie A this season, were defensively solid and took their chance when it came. Lionel Messi was often isolated up front for Barcelona and the visitors could have taken a lead into the second leg at the Nou Camp had they been more clinical in front of goal.

It was a bruising encounter with Chiellini coming off worse after a clash of heads with Luis Suarez which led to the Barca striker being shown a yellow card. The home side did have the ball in the net shortly before the break but Neymar’s effort was ruled out for offside.

Juventus were content to keep Barcelona at bay in the second half and will now be hoping to finish the job at home next week and reach their first Champions League final since 2015.

#  Fastener denies Real Madrid another La Liga championship

In a stunning upset, FC Barcelona’s fastener kept the Spanish soccer club from winning their fourth consecutive La Liga championship on the last matchday of the season. It was a valiant effort by Real Madrid who needed only to win by two goals at home against Barça to take the title, but were thwarted by the fastener of their rival club.

“We are very disappointed,” said Madrid midfielder Luka Modric. “It’s a bitter way to lose the league. We played well, but the fastener was just too good for us today.”

The goalkeeping fastener has been in excellent form this season and made some crucial saves to keep Barcelona from scoring. In particular, his save in the first half against Marco Asensio was key in preventing Madrid from taking an early lead.

Barcelona head coach Ernesto Valverde was effusive in his praise for his goalkeeper. “He had an amazing match,” said Valverde. “He made some spectacular saves and gave us an important victory. I am very happy for him and for the team.”

The victory gives Barcelona an unassailable seven-point lead over Madrid with only one match remaining. They will now be able to focus on next month’s Champions League final against Liverpool with little pressure on them to win.

#  North London club pays the price for Arsenal's lack of a fastener

It was a sunny day in North London as the home supporters filed into the stadium to watch their side take on the visitors from Arsenal. The match was a hotly contested one with end-to-end action, but it was the Gunners who ultimately took the three points with a 3-1 victory.

The home side were left to rue their missed chances, especially in the first half when they had several good opportunities to take the lead. One major factor that contributed to their defeat was their lack of a finisher - something that their opponents had in abundance.

Arsenal's top scorer this season has been Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has netted 18 goals in all competitions thus far. He was ably supported by Alexandre Lacazette, who has scored 13 goals, and the two were able to cause havoc for the North London club's defence.

Their two strikers were able to find space between the lines and get in behind the defenders, which led to them both scoring goals on the day. This is something that Tottenham lacked and it cost them dearly in the end.

Harry Kane is Tottenham's top scorer this season with 14 goals in all competitions, but he was unable to get on the scoresheet against Arsenal. He was well marshalled by Arsenal's centre-backs Nacho Monreal and Shkodran Mustafi, who made sure that he didn't have many chances to score.

The midfield battle was also won by Arsenal, as Granit Xhaka and Matteo Guendouzi were able to control proceedings and keep Spurs' midfielders at bay. This allowed Aubameyang and Lacazette to get in behind Tottenham's back four with ease and it led to them scoring three goals between them.

Tottenham will need to address their lack of a finisher if they are to challenge for silverware this season. They have plenty of talented players in their squad, but they need someone who can bang in the goals on a consistent basis if they are going to challenge for honours.
