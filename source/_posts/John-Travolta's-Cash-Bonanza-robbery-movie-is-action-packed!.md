Just when we thought that "The Taking of Pelham 123" might be the only heist movie on the horizon, John Travolta steps in to give us "The Forger." The film is set to star Travolta as a father who tries to get his son out of jail by forging a painting for a notorious art thief. This is sounding like it could be a pretty great movie!

With the Coen brothers producing and Travolta in the lead role, we're bound to get something interesting out of this film. It's not often that you see a father-son story told in the context of a heist movie, so this should be a real treat for fans of the genre. We don't have too many details about the plot yet, but it's clear that this is going to be one fun movie to watch!

Travolta has been pretty busy over the past few years, with roles in "Savages," "Killing Season" and "Gotti." He's definitely shown that he still has what it takes to bring an audience into the theaters. We can't wait to see him take on this new role and hope that it will mark a resurgence for him in terms of box office success.

If everything goes according to plan, filming will start next month in Toronto. We'll be sure to keep you updated on all of the latest news surrounding this exciting new project!
