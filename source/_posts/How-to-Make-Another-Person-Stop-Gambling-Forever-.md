#  How to Make Another Person Stop Gambling Forever 

There is often a feeling of desperation that comes with gambling addiction. A person may feel like they are out of control and doomed to keep repeating the same destructive behaviors over and over again. But there is hope. There are ways to make someone stop gambling forever.

The first step is understanding the addiction itself. Gambling addiction is a type of impulse control disorder. This means that the person has trouble resisting urges or temptations, in this case, the urge to gamble. It can be difficult to overcome because it's often accompanied by strong cravings and a feeling of euphoria when winning.

But there are steps that can be taken to help someone break their addiction. One approach is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT helps people identify and change the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to their addiction. Another approach is motivational interviewing, which helps people find their own reasons for wanting to change their behavior.

 family support is also important. Family members can provide emotional support and help keep the person accountable. They can also provide practical support, like helping them find resources or monitoring their gambling behavior.

Ultimately, it takes commitment and effort from both the addicted person and their loved ones to overcome gambling addiction. But it's definitely possible with the right tools and resources.
